## 1_Line_Chart

The interesting part is to set each symbol with a specific shape.


## 2_Error_Bar_Chart

This one is not usual, as the multi-categorical error bars were suppose to be overlapped with each other.
In order to spread them along the X axis, I use the facet charts, hid the gap between facets, and draw the border of the facets.
